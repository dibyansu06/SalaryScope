# SalaryScope


## **Project Summary**

This notebook explores **salary prediction using machine learning**, leveraging a dataset that includes job-related attributes such as industry, company size, job role, and required skills.  

### **Key Steps Covered:**  
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting useful features.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing key trends and insights using various plots.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation** – Implementing **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**, followed by hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.  
- **Model Explainability** – Analyzing feature importance to understand key salary-driving factors.  
- **Model Deployment** – Saving the best model and performing a sanity check with unseen data.  

This project provides valuable insights into salary estimation, helping **job seekers, recruiters, and employers** make informed decisions based on data-driven salary trends.


## **Problem Statement**

In today’s competitive job market, understanding salary trends is crucial for both job seekers and employers. However, salary estimates often vary across industries, job roles, and company attributes, making it challenging to determine fair compensation.  

The objective of this project is to **develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts salary estimates based on job-related features** such as company rating, job location, industry, required skills, and company size. By leveraging regression models, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, we aim to build a reliable salary prediction system that can assist:  

- **Job Seekers** in making informed career decisions based on expected compensation.  
- **Employers** in benchmarking salaries against industry standards to attract top talent.  
- **HR Professionals & Recruiters** in optimizing salary structures and improving hiring efficiency.  

This project ultimately helps **bridge the salary expectation gap**, ensuring a more transparent and data-driven approach to compensation analysis.
